**Objective:** Conducted a comprehensive benchmark of deep learning architectures to develop a robust Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) capable of identifying malicious network traffic with high precision, addressing the critical challenge of class imbalance in cyber-security datasets.

**Features:**
* **Model Benchmarking:** Evaluated and compared the performance of Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
* **Imbalance Mitigation:** Solved extreme class imbalance inherent in network traffic data using Focal Loss and Adam optimization.
* **High Performance:** Achieved an 87% balanced accuracy rate, ensuring reliable detection of both frequent and rare attack types.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented rigorous data cleaning and normalization pipelines to ensure model robustness across different network environments.

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch/Keras, Pandas, Scikit-learn, CNN, RNN, Focal Loss.
